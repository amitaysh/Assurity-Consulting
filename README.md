Simple Python script which calls API in NZ server and verifies specific values are in the replied JSON.
The script includes 3 tests (unittests):
1. Happy path, just call the API and search for correct expected values.
2. Fail flow, call the API and search for "bad" value (existing, but in a different sub-element)
3. Consecutive fail flow, call the API and search for several "bad" values

To execute this script - just call it :)
python script.py
